# In case of emergency backend

## What is this?

This is a simple go api I built to teach myself some of the basics of the language. It integrates with a solidJS frontend to allow me to send emergency plans for outdoor adventures to my family.

## Why did I build it?

It's important to always leave plans of where you're going and when people should expect to hear back from you when exploring backcountry areas, particularly without cell reception. It's also fun to hack together little projects with no professional incentives.

## Where can I learn more?

I'll publish a blog post about the project soon! It's pretty simple.
